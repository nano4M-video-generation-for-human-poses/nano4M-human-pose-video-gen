# M4 Enhancements & Debugging Aids

This note focuses on the **quality-of-life changes** we added on top of the original M3 codebase to make development smoother and training far more robust.

## 1  Smarter `forward_decoder(···)`
### What changed?
The old decoder stub simply looked up embeddings and called the Transformer; any sample that contained padded time-steps could feed **all-False attention rows** into PyTorch which—depending on the kernel—would yield NaNs.

The new implementation adds four guard stages:
1. **Derive validity masks** for decoder queries (`valid_q`) and encoded keys (`valid_enc`).
2. **Build self- and cross-attention masks** that respect padding:  
   `dec_pad_sa_mask = valid_q.unsqueeze(2) & valid_q.unsqueeze(1)`  
   `dec_pad_xa_mask = valid_q.unsqueeze(2) & valid_enc.unsqueeze(1)`
3. **Guarantee at least one key** per query row using `torch.where`; this prevents the “all masked” soft‑max corner case.
4. **Zero out embeddings of padded queries** so they do not leak into residual streams.

### Why is it good?
* **Numerical safety** – rows with no valid keys can no longer generate `-inf → NaN` in the soft‑max.
* **Stable gradients** – masking padded queries before the projection avoids meaningless activations inside the residual stack.
* **Portability** – works identically with Flash‑Attention kernels.

## 2  Watchdogs inside `compute_ce_loss`
Training large multimodal language models often fails *silently*. We inserted three lightweight checks — each raises a clear, actionable error **before** the optimiser step:

| # | What it checks | Why it matters |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| **1** | `torch.isfinite(logits)` | Catches NaNs/Infs coming from the network (e.g. exploding activations) early; prints min/max and first bad index for quick triage. |
| **2** | Target IDs ∈ \[0, *vocab*) ∪ {`padding_idx`} | Flags corrupt batches where the data loader produced out‑of‑range tokens (common after merges or re‑tokenisation). |
| **3** | All *trainable* parameters are finite | Detects layers whose weights blew up, printing the exact tensor name so you can add gradient clipping or reduce LR. |

All three run on the **forward path** only and add negligible overhead when the model is healthy.

## 3  `run_training.py` one‑batch smoke test
Before the main loop starts we execute a **single batch end‑to‑end** under `torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)`:

1. Ensure every sample has at least one *target* token (guards against empty captions / poses).
2. Confirm all token IDs stay inside their per‑modality vocabularies.
3. Run forward **and backward** once; any size mismatch, dtype issue or divergent gradient aborts immediately.

This “fail‑fast” step has saved countless GPU hours by surfacing data/shape bugs **within seconds**, especially on multi‑node jobs where restarting is costly.

### TL;DR
These enhancements turn the training script from *“cross your fingers”* into a **self‑diagnosing pipeline** that:
* masks padding correctly,
* validates data integrity every step,
* and crashes early with precise error messages.
